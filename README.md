It allows teams to collaborate in real-time on support tickets, track conversations, assign priorities, and keep customers in the loop. With features like a built-in knowledge base, detailed analytics, and secure file handling, the system is designed to scale with growing businesses while keeping things smooth, secure, and easy to use
